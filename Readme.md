This is a repo for a small static website displaying my day 19 entry to the #30DayMapChallenge, and my first project using HTML and CSS.
The challenge is an annual event in which each day in November is assigned a theme and the goal is to produce a map for each day.

You can read more about the challenge on the official challenge [site](https://30daymapchallenge.com/).

To see my other entries you can visit my [repo](https://github.com/VikkiWalls/30-Day-Map-Challenge-2022) for the challenge.
